Public repo for analyzing pre- and post-module assessment data for Macrosystems EDDIE Module 8: Using Ecological Forecasts to Guide Decision-Making

This study contains anonymized and aggregated human subject data collected from pre- and post-surveys following student completion of Macrosystems EDDIE Module 8. All students and faculty consented to participate in the study per our Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocols (Virginia Tech IRB 19-669 and Carleton College IRB 19-20 065). The data contained in this repository have been pre-processed to remove any sensitive or personally identifying information. All code and data contained with this repo are sufficient to recreate figures and statistics associated with the manuscript "Embedding communication concepts in forecasting training increases students' understanding of ecological uncertainty" submitted to Ecosphere in March 2023.
